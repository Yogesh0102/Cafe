	<h2>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>
	<p>
		I adopted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross.<br/>
		Sydney, I have beeen after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really beleive are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
	</p>
	<p>
		This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why, it has to be tasted to be beloved.
