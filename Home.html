	<h3>A community cafe serving<br/>home cooked, locally<br/>sourced, organic food</h3>
	<p>With stunning views of the ocean. Example Cafe<br/>offers the perfect environment to unwind and<br/>recharge the batteries.</p>
	<p>Our menu offers a side range of breakfasts,<br/>brunches and lunches, including a range of<br/>vegetarian options.</p>
	<p>Whether you sip on a fresh hot coffee or a cooling<br/>smoothie, you never need to feel rushed, relax with<br/>friends or just watch the world go by.</p>
	<h3>This weekend's special<br/>brunch</h3>
	<p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is<br/>that they are made with half cream and cookied in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.</p>
